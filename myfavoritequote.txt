The foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.

To me, this means that we have no idea how we will change or what we will lose until we have changed, until we have lost. So we are always looking back at ourselves as we once were, from the new perspective of how we are now.
